To differentiate between local variants arising from a recent introduction and imported variants with greater genetic differences than is expected from local diversification, we used a pragmatic criterion previously described in:

https://jvi.asm.org/content/89/22/11630

A variant is a virus (or a group of viruses) within a genotype that possesses ≥x nucleotide differences compared to other viruses. This x nucleotide differences (N<sub>d</sub>) is a product of the length of the genomic region analysed (L<sub>a</sub>), estimated substitution rate for that region (S<sub>r</sub>), and time (T<sub>e</sub>). 

*N<sub>d</sub> = L<sub>a</sub> × S<sub>r</sub> × T<sub>e</sub>*

Then calculate

*N<sub>d</sub>/L<sub>a</sub> X 100*

to get the % difference which was then used in usearch v8.1.1861
